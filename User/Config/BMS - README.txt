Please see the "Docs\Key Files & Input" folder for
a full documentation on the new BMS keystroke files:

BMS - Blank.key
BMS - Minimum.key
BMS - Basic.key
BMS - Full.key
BMS - Pitbuilder.key

While these files contain a different amount of mapped
callbacks, the actual keyboard mapping (except for the
"Blank" file) is always identical.
