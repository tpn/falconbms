-Import the "AVCS Falcon BMS Radios (v1.43) Package (IMPORT THIS).vax" Profile Package into VoiceAttack
  
  !!!  AVCS CORE profile for VoiceAttack (version 1.11 or higher) is required.   !!!


On first import, the main initialization script will attempt to execute to load all config files needed.
If you wish to review the profile before using it for the first time, hold CTRL+SHIFT+B before switching
to any AVCS profile to bypass initialization commands (restart may be required afterwards)

AVCS CORE manages all AVCS4 Profile initializations, and updating, and will switch between AVCS profiles
as needed during intialization and first time installation.  Always load AVCS CORE before any AVCS4 Profile.
Say, 'Set a Preferred Profile' to set a specific profile to auto-switch to after AVCS CORE has initialized.

To use AVCS CORE as a support framework for any of your own profiles, include AVCS CORE commands in the other
profile, or set AVCS CORE as a Global Profile in VoiceAttack options.  AVCS CORE can switch to your profile 
after it is done loading itself.


-To manually initialize (or re-initialize) any AVCS profile, say, "Initialize Profile"

NOTES TO NEW USERS:
Read a semicolon ";" as the word "or" and look at long commands as having many options like saying "2;Two;Too;To;Wingman"  (read as "2 -or- Two -or- Too -or- To -or- Wingman")

Description:
These commands use VoiceAttack to translate the in-game on-screen radio menus from AWACS through Tanker into natural and intelligent voice command phrases that will fire keypress macros to help keep hands on the throttle and stick, and maintain immersion.  As an additional option, these commands can be locked behind a push-to-talk mode bound to your UHF/VHF transmit buttons in-game, allowing any other VoiceAttack command unrestricted access if needed, while still restricting these BMS radio command macros.
Finally, the profile is extremely easy to edit or integrate into other profiles.

At VETERANS-GAMING, we fly with friends or AI Pilots, or a mix of both on our 24/7 Public Korean Campaign in Falcon BMS.  I may go out with an AI wingman only to have a friend take his place mid-flight.  For this reason and others, I created this VoiceAttack profile based around restricting when the computer can execute keypress macros that match voice phrases, having to first check if that pilot was set to a human pilot and therefore disregard commands for that pilot.
