-Import the "AVCS CORE (v1.11) Package (IMPORT THIS).vax" Profile Package into VoiceAttack.
    (this is just a .zip file with a renamed extention to .vax, see VoiceAttack Manual pg. 215 for more info)
  
  !!!  AVCS CORE profile (version 1.00 or higher) for VoiceAttack is required for any AVCS4 Profile(s) !!!


On first import, the main initialization script will attempt to execute to load all config files needed.
If you wish to review the profile before using it for the first time, hold CTRL+SHIFT+B before switching
to any AVCS profile to bypass initialization commands (restart may be required afterwards)

AVCS CORE manages all AVCS4 Profile initializations, and updating, and will switch between AVCS profiles
as needed during intialization and first time installation.  Always load AVCS CORE before any AVCS4 Profile.
Say, 'Set a Preferred Profile' to auto-switch to after AVCS CORE has initialized.

Say, 'Open CORE Options Menu' for profile control menu.

To use AVCS CORE as a support framework for any of your own profiles, include AVCS CORE commands in the other
profile. AVCS CORE should not be a Global Profile in VoiceAttack options for ease of updating.  AVCS CORE can
switch to your profile after it is done loading itself, so you may set AVCS CORE to load at VoiceAttack startup.


-To manually initialize (or re-initialize) any AVCS profile, say, "Initialize Profile"

NOTES TO NEW USERS:
Read a semicolon ";" as the word "or" and look at long commands as having many options like saying "2;Two;Too;To;Wingman"  (read as "2 -or- Two -or- Too -or- To -or- Wingman")

  **NOTE FOR UPDATING from v1.0 to v1.11:
   AVCS CORE v1.11 will also import a new 'AVCS4 USER PROFILE TEMPLATE (v1.0)' - this template has not been changed
   If you had AVCS CORE v1.0 and that template profile, you can delete this duplicate 'AVCS4 USER PROFILE TEMPLATE (v1.0)'

   Follow instructions during update to uninstall and delete the previous AVCS CORE v1.0 profile and config files

Thanks for checking out AVCS CORE!
